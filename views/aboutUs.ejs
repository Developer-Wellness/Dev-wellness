        <h3>Sue Tarazi</h3>
        <p>Bio: I'm Dr. Sue Tarazi, and I believe in giving people a better quality of life. After Owning a Physical Therapy Private Practice for over 9 years that operated in the black every year, I decided to branch out and make the transition to becoming a software developer. 
        I still love health and wellness as well as caring for others on a large scale, but being in tech actually allows me to work with a team on a product or service that can improve the lives of a greater number of people.            
        Transitioning careers to a full-stack JavaScript software developer means I also bring with me the skills of organizing and running a project, excellent problem solving skills, the ability to connect with others as well as my lifelong love of learning that I have possessed for years.</p>
