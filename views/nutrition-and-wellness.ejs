        Gotu kola is a member of the parsley family and is used to balance out the nervous system. It not only aids in stress reduction and reducing anxiety, but it also improves mental alertness and memory. This herb is a relaxant and is caffeine-free, despite the word <em>kola</em> in its name.

        <article class = "herbs"><p><h3>Ginseng</h3>
        Ginseng contains <em>ginsenosides</em> which have anti-oxitant and anti-inflammatory functions and also aid in brain function by stimulating the release of acetylcholine which is a neurotransmitter associated with learning and memory. When taken together with Gingko, both working and long-term memory are enhanced. Ginseng also boosts mood and increases resilience to stress.

        Peppermint increases alertness, memory and cognitive function. The scent or taste of peppermint stimulates the hippocampus in the brain which plays an important role in memory. It also slows the release of the stress-hormone cortisol and therefore has a calming effect on the body.

        <article>We know inflammation in the body can contribute to brain fog, which isn't good when you're trying to perform a task like coding, that takes a lot of focused attention. See below for the biggest culprits of inflammation in the body as well as a list of some anti-inflammatory foods. After all, we are what we eat. </article><br><br>

        <h2>Foods that can Cause Inflammation and Brain Fog</h2>

        <img src = "images/alcohol.jpg"></div>
    </div>
    <p>Dairy, wheat, refined sugar and alcohol can all increase inflammation and cause brain fog in the body. Some people are particularly sensitive and do better with avoidance, but for most of us, we are fine consuming these in our diet in moderation.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2>Anti-inflammatory Foods</h2>
    <p>The following is a list of foods that have been shown to fight inflammation in the body. Many of these foods have other benefits such as reducing cancer risk and heart-disease</p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Berries</em> - Berries of all types contain anti-oxidants and anthocyanins, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and boost immunity.</li>
        <li><em>Fish</em> - Fish, particularly fatty fish such as salmon, sardines and anchovies are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which have an anti-inflammatory effect.</li>
        <li><em>Cruciferous Vegetables</em> - Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, kale, brussel sprouts and cauliflower contain the anti-oxidant sulforaphane, which has anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
        <li><em>Peppers & Tomatoes</em> - Peppers and tomatoes are part of the nightshade family. Peppers are high in quercetin while  tomatoes are high in lycopene which contributes to anti-inflammatory effects in the body.</li>
        <li><em>Tumeric</em> - Tumeric is a spice that contains curcumin, which is a powerful anti-inflammatory substance. It's absorption in the body is significantly increased when combined with black pepper.</li>

    <h1>Mindfulness</h1>
    <section>Mindfulness and stress reduction can play a important part in allowing you to function at your best. When we are feeling stressed or our mind is preoccupied, we have difficulty focusing on tasks at hand and our problem-solving skills become compromised.</section>

    <h2>Meditation</h2>
<div>
    <div class="circular--landscape3">

    </div>
    <p>Daily meditation, even just a few minutes a day, can allow us to take control of our busy mind and train our mind to focus on tasks and activities without being as distracted.<br><br><br><br>
    There are many different meditation techniques that work. Here's one that I find simple and effective.<br><br>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Set a timer for anywhere between 5-8 minutes. Longer works fine too if you'd like.</li>
    <li>Begin sitting in good posture on the floor. You may need to sit on a cushion or folded blanket to keep yourself seated on your sit-bones. Alternatively, you can sit in a chair.</li>
    <li>Begin by taking deep inhalations and exhalations. Let your breathing be slow.</li>
    <li>Allow your mind to focus on your breath, but not on anything else until the timer goes off.</li>
    <li>Understand that meditation is a practice. Your mind WILL wander, especially at first. Be kind to yourself and just gently refocus when that happens.</li> 
</ol>
